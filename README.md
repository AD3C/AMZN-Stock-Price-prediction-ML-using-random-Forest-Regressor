Thisis a demo stock price predictor using random forest regressor for Stock price of Amazon stock.
1.AMZN10 to 12
2.Amzn13to16
3.Amzn17to18
4.Amzn19to23

These four files are stock data from 2010 to 2023. the model in the Github is only trained on AMZN19to23 data. A lot of modelling & training needs to be done to predict the exact pricing. Current score of the model is still leaves a lot of room for improvement.
Therefore do not consider this as a final training model.
